# Python Program to Check if a Number is Odd or Even

num = int(input("Enter the number : "))           # take user input


# why we have choose 2 for odd & even?
# because whenever we checks whether this digit is even or odd, we divid it on 2.

if (num % 2) == 0:
    print("{0} is Even number".format(num))

else:
    print("{1} is Odd number".format(num))
